        <p>Dahlia is a genus of bushy, tuberous, herbaceous perennial plants native to Mexico
             and Central America. A member of the Compositae (also called Asteraceae) family 
             of dicotyledonous plants, its garden relatives thus include the sunflower,
              daisy, chrysanthemum, and zinnia. There are 42 species of dahlia, with hybrids 
              commonly grown as garden plants. Flower forms are variable, with one head per 
              stem; these can be as small as 5 cm (2 in) diameter or up to 30 cm (1 ft) 
              ("dinner plate").
